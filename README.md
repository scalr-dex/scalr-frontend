# Frontend code for scalr telegram mini app

TODO: create a `theme.ts` file that integrates with tailwind.config.js and can be used inside the app

## Local launch

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`
2. Check `.env.sample` and create a `.env` file in project root
3. Run the server with `yarn start`
4. You can test in your browser, but you'll need a tg-bot

## Testing inside Telegram with Hot Module Reload

1. Install [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/)
   - Note that you don't need to select a domain, simply login in your browser
2. Run `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173/`, it will create a temporary link
3. Setup a bot in a [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), don't use `Scalr` when naming so it won't popup in a telegram search.
   Use the link from `cloudflared`
   - No, you don't need test telegram account, your primary account is better because you can use it on any device (test accounts are not supported by Android)
4. Open the app in you mobile device and check if it works

- **Can I use `ngrok`?** - yes you can, but it will shut down in 3 hours, while you can keep `cloudflared` alive for days
- **Can I host using vite?** - I tried, it didn't work
